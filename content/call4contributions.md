- Feedbacks/Lessons learned/Success stories from artifacts authors, reviewers, chairs, trying to package an experiment or trying to reproduce an experiment
- Methods to create a "minimal reproducible experiment" to proxy the reproduction on the energy consumming full-scale version
- Energy-efficient artifact reproduction in HPC
- Case studies of sustainable (or unsustainable) artifact evaluation in HPC
- Long-term reproduciblity: ensuring artifacts remain accessible and evaluable as hardware/software evolves
- Feedback from teaching HPC reproducibility principles
- Methods and tools to create a standalone and portable experiment
- Methods and tools to support reproducibility in HPC from the early development stages
- Methods and tools to support FAIR principles
- Methods and tools to support provenance
- Tools and services that should be offered by HPC centers and testbeds to improve/support reproducibility
- Billing, access, and "security" to HPC centers and testbeds for reproduction attempts
- Proposals for new Artifact Evaluations processes (timelines, badges, reports, interactions between authors and reviewers, reviewer roles, etc.)
- Incentives and recognition for Reproducibility in HPC (for authors and reviewers)
- Human-centric sustainability: reducing reviewer/author fatigue and chair workload.
- Community standards for balancing rigor, efficiency, and human effort
